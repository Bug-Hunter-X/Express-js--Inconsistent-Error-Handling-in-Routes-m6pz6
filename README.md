# Express.js: Inconsistent Error Handling in Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inconsistent error handling in routes.  Improper error handling can lead to unexpected behavior, including:

* **Information Leakage:** Sensitive data might be exposed in error messages.
* **Application Crashes:** Unhandled exceptions can bring down the server.
* **Poor User Experience:** Users might encounter cryptic error messages.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js`.  (Observe the lack of robust error handling.)
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` (Observe the improved error handling.)

## Solution:

The solution involves implementing comprehensive error handling using try-catch blocks and centralized error middleware.
